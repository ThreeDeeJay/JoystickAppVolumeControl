# Joystick App Volume Control

Windows app to control system-wide or per-app volume using DirectInput controller/gamepad/joystick/throttle/pedal axes. Made with Copilot. 
We can run multiple instances for multiple axis-to-app bindings. For example, I'm using it to map TWCS' thottle to the master system volume, and the pinky dial for specific apps, in this case FreeTube.
